## 1. Operating Systems (OS)

### Overview  
An operating system is the backbone software that manages hardware resources and provides essential services to applications. It ensures efficient execution of processes and effective resource management while providing a secure and stable environment.

### In-Depth Concepts

#### Processes and Threads
- **Processes:**  
  - Independent executing programs with their own memory space.  
  - **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):** Techniques include pipes, message queues, shared memory, sockets, and signals.
  - **System Calls:** Interfaces (like `fork()`, `exec()`, `wait()`) that allow processes to request services from the OS kernel.

- **Threads:**  
  - Lightweight units within a process sharing the same memory.  
  - **Multithreading Models:**  
    - User-level threads versus kernel-level threads.  
    - Concurrency vs. parallelism.  
  - **Thread Libraries:** POSIX Threads (pthreads), Java Threads, etc.

#### CPU Scheduling
- **Algorithms:**  
  - **Non-preemptive:** First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF).  
  - **Preemptive:** Round Robin (RR), Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF).  
  - **Multilevel Queue Scheduling:** Processes are divided into different queues with separate scheduling algorithms.  
  - **Multilevel Feedback Queue:** Dynamically adjusts priorities based on process behavior.
- **Real-Time Scheduling:**  
  - Algorithms like Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS) and Earliest Deadline First (EDF) for time-critical applications.
- **Context Switching:**  
  - Saving and restoring process states; an overhead that affects system performance.

#### Memory Management
- **Techniques:**  
  - **Paging:** Divides memory into fixed-size pages.  
  - **Segmentation:** Divides memory into variable-length segments based on logical divisions.
  - **Virtual Memory:** Combines hardware and software to allow a computer to compensate for physical memory shortages, using disk space.
- **Page Replacement Algorithms:**  
  - FIFO, Least Recently Used (LRU), Optimal, and Clock algorithms.
- **Fragmentation:**  
  - **Internal:** Wasted space within allocated memory.  
  - **External:** Wasted space between allocated memory blocks.

#### File Systems and I/O Management
- **File System Structures:**  
  - Hierarchical organization (directories, subdirectories).  
  - Allocation methods: contiguous, linked, and indexed allocation.
- **I/O Systems:**  
  - Buffering and caching for performance improvement.  
  - Asynchronous I/O versus synchronous I/O.  
  - Device drivers and Direct Memory Access (DMA) for efficient data transfer.

#### Concurrency and Synchronization
- **Critical Section Problem:**  
  - Ensuring that multiple processes/threads do not access shared resources simultaneously.
- **Synchronization Mechanisms:**  
  - **Mutexes and Semaphores:** Prevent race conditions.  
  - **Monitors and Locks:** Higher-level synchronization constructs.
- **Deadlock:**  
  - **Conditions:** Mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, and circular wait.  
  - **Handling Techniques:** Deadlock prevention, avoidance (Banker’s algorithm), detection, and recovery.

#### Advanced Topics
- **Virtualization and Containers:**  
  - Virtual machines (VMs) and containerization (Docker, Kubernetes) that isolate processes.
- **Security and Protection:**  
  - Memory protection, user authentication, and access control lists (ACLs).

**Example: Semaphore-Based Critical Section in C (Pseudo-code)**

```c
// Pseudo-code example demonstrating semaphore usage
#include <semaphore.h>
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>

sem_t mutex;

void* critical_section(void *arg) {
    sem_wait(&mutex);   // Acquire semaphore
    // Access shared resource (critical section)
    printf("Thread %ld is in the critical section.\n", (long)arg);
    sem_post(&mutex);   // Release semaphore
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    sem_init(&mutex, 0, 1);  // Initialize semaphore to 1
    pthread_t threads[3];
    for (long i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, critical_section, (void*)i);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        pthread_join(threads[i], NULL);
    }
    sem_destroy(&mutex);
    return 0;
}
```

## 2. Database Management Systems (DBMS)

### Overview  
A DBMS is software designed to store, retrieve, and manage data in databases. It provides mechanisms for data integrity, security, and multi-user access.

### In-Depth Concepts

#### Database Models
- **Relational Model:**  
  - Data stored in tables with rows and columns; relationships managed via foreign keys.
  - **SQL:** Standard language for querying and manipulating relational databases.
- **NoSQL Models:**  
  - **Document Stores:** e.g., MongoDB (store JSON-like documents).  
  - **Key-Value Stores:** e.g., Redis.  
  - **Column Family:** e.g., Cassandra.  
  - **Graph Databases:** e.g., Neo4j.

#### SQL – DDL, DML, and Beyond
- **Data Definition Language (DDL):**  
  - Commands like `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP` to define schema.
- **Data Manipulation Language (DML):**  
  - Commands like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.
- **Data Control Language (DCL):**  
  - `GRANT` and `REVOKE` to manage permissions.

#### ACID Properties
- **Atomicity:** Ensures a transaction is all-or-nothing.
- **Consistency:** Ensures the database remains in a valid state.
- **Isolation:** Concurrent transactions do not interfere.
- **Durability:** Once committed, transactions persist despite failures.

#### Normalization and Denormalization
- **Normalization:**  
  - Steps to remove redundancy: 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, and Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF).
- **Denormalization:**  
  - Deliberate redundancy to improve read performance in certain scenarios.

#### Indexing and Query Optimization
- **Indexes:**  
  - Data structures (B-tree, B+ tree, hash indexes) to speed up queries.
  - **Clustering vs. Non-Clustering Indexes:** Physical order versus logical pointers.
- **Query Optimization:**  
  - Execution plans, cost-based optimizers, and the use of hints.

#### Transactions and Concurrency Control
- **Isolation Levels:**  
  - Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, Serializable.
- **Locking Mechanisms:**  
  - Shared vs. exclusive locks, lock granularity (row-level vs. table-level).
- **Distributed Transactions:**  
  - Two-phase commit (2PC) protocols for multi-node databases.

#### Additional Concepts
- **CAP Theorem:**  
  - Trade-offs in distributed databases between Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance.
- **Replication:**  
  - Master-slave and multi-master replication for data redundancy and fault tolerance.

**Example: SQL Query with Subquery and Join**

```sql
-- Creating tables with normalization in mind
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    dept_name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(50),
    dept_id INT,
    salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES Departments(dept_id)
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO Departments (dept_id, dept_name) VALUES (1, 'Sales'), (2, 'Engineering');
INSERT INTO Employees (emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary) 
VALUES (101, 'John Doe', 1, 50000.00),
       (102, 'Jane Smith', 2, 75000.00),
       (103, 'Alice Brown', 1, 55000.00);

-- Query to find employees with salaries above the average
SELECT e.emp_id, e.emp_name, d.dept_name, e.salary
FROM Employees e
JOIN Departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
WHERE e.salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Employees);
```

## 4. Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)

### Overview  
OOPS is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects" that encapsulate data and behavior. It emphasizes reusability, modularity, and maintainability.

### In-Depth Concepts

#### Fundamental Principles
- **Encapsulation:**  
  - Bundling data and methods into a single unit (class).  
  - Using access modifiers (`private`, `protected`, `public`) to hide internal state.

- **Inheritance:**  
  - Allows a class (child) to inherit attributes and methods from another (parent).  
  - **Composition vs. Inheritance:** Prefer composition for "has-a" relationships; use inheritance for "is-a" relationships.
  
- **Polymorphism:**  
  - **Compile-Time (Static):** Method overloading, operator overloading (where supported).  
  - **Run-Time (Dynamic):** Method overriding, where a subclass can provide a specific implementation of a method declared in its superclass.

- **Abstraction:**  
  - Hiding complex implementation details behind a simpler interface.  
  - Achieved via abstract classes and interfaces.

#### Design Principles and Patterns
- **SOLID Principles:**  
  - **S**ingle Responsibility, **O**pen/Closed, **L**iskov Substitution, **I**nterface Segregation, **D**ependency Inversion.
- **Common Design Patterns:**  
  - **Creational Patterns:** Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder.  
  - **Structural Patterns:** Adapter, Composite, Decorator, Facade.  
  - **Behavioral Patterns:** Observer, Strategy, Command, Iterator.
- **UML Diagrams:**  
  - Class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and use case diagrams help visualize OOP designs.

#### Language-Specific Insights
- **Java/C++:**  
  - Difference between interfaces (Java) and abstract classes.  
  - Memory management differences (garbage collection vs. manual).
- **Python:**  
  - Dynamic typing and duck typing in OOP.
- **Best Practices:**  
  - Favor composition over inheritance when possible.  
  - Write modular, testable, and reusable code.

**Example: Java OOP with SOLID Principles**

```java
// Abstract class demonstrating abstraction and enforcing a contract
abstract class Employee {
    private String name;
    
    Employee(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    
    // Abstract method forcing subclasses to provide their own implementation
    abstract double calculateSalary();
    
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}

// Concrete subclass demonstrating inheritance and polymorphism
class FullTimeEmployee extends Employee {
    private double baseSalary;
    private double bonus;
    
    FullTimeEmployee(String name, double baseSalary, double bonus) {
        super(name);
        this.baseSalary = baseSalary;
        this.bonus = bonus;
    }
    
    @Override
    double calculateSalary() {
        return baseSalary + bonus;
    }
}

// Using the classes with polymorphism and adhering to SOLID principles
public class OOPAdvancedExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee emp = new FullTimeEmployee("Alice", 50000, 5000);
        System.out.println("Employee: " + emp.getName());
        System.out.println("Total Salary: " + emp.calculateSalary());
    }
}
```
